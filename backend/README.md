# GovConnect Backend

NestJS-based authentication backend with comprehensive user management and security features.

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Node.js (for npm scripts)

## Quick Start

### Start Development Environment

```bash
npm run docker:dev
```

This starts all essential services:

- Backend API (http://localhost:3000)
- PostgreSQL Database
- MinIO File Storage (http://localhost:9001)
- MailHog Email Testing (http://localhost:8025)
- Redis Cache

### Check Services

```bash
npm run docker:status
```

### View Logs

```bash
npm run docker:dev:logs
```

### Stop Services

```bash
npm run docker:dev:stop
```

## Test Authentication

### Health Check

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

### Register User

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/auth/register \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"password123","firstName":"John","lastName":"Doe","username":"johndoe"}'
```

### Login

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/auth/login \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"password123"}'
```

### Two-Factor Authentication

When a user with enabled 2FA logs in, the system automatically sends a verification code to the user's email address. The login process will then require this verification code to complete authentication.

#### Enable 2FA for a User

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/auth/enable-2fa \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

#### Complete Login with 2FA

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/auth/verify-2fa \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","verificationCode":"123456"}'
```
